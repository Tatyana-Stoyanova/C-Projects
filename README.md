# C-Projects
C exercises

The solution consists of 21 C projects. Each of the projects is a solution to a given task. The conditions of the relevant tasks are defined as follows:

Project 1:
The user submits some integers and types -999 to stop the submission. Find the average of all digits before -999.

Project 2:
User defines the number of digits n. Print first n digits from the Fibonacci sequence.

Project 3:
User submits an integer. Print the sum of all digits.

Project 4:
User submits an integer. Print the number in reverse.

Project 5:
User submits an integer. Find all prime factors of that integer.

Project 6:
Find the factorial of an user defined integer n.

Project 7:
Turn an user-submitted integer n into it's binary representation.

Project 8:
Turn an user-submitted binary number into it's decimal representation.

Project 9:
Check whether an user-submitted char is a upper case, lower case letter (or not a letter at all). 

Project 10:
Find the sum of the squares of the first n natural integers. N is user-submitted integer.

Project 11:
User submits a number n and your program should check if it is an exact square.

Project 12:
The user submits n integers. Find the greatest one. N is defined by the user.

Project 13:
Find the sum of all integers <= n and determine whether the sum is even or not. N is defined by the user.

Project 14:
Check if there are repeating digits in an user-submitted integer n.

Project 15:
User submits 5 integers and you have to order them in ascending order.

Project 16:
User submits 5 integers and you have to order them in descending order.

Project 17:
User submits a positive integer N. Print all even numbers in the range 0...N.

Project 18:
Check if given positive integer N is prime or not.

Project 19:
Check if an user-submitted number is an three-digit number or not.

Project 20:
User submits 10 integers and you have to sort them in ascending order.

Project 21:
Check if an user-submitted three-digit number is an Armstrong number or not.
